The topics in this section describe how to automate the installation, configuration, and upgrade of your PCF deployment. To perform these steps manually, see the [Installing and Configuring](../installing/index.html) and [Upgrading](../upgrading/index.html) sections.

To build a pipeline that performs a fresh deploy of PCF, see the [Building a Fresh Deploy Pipeline](fresh-pipeline.html) topic. This pipeline is designed for development and test environments because it runs destructive tests and tears down the environment.

To build an upgrade pipeline keeps your PCF components up to date with the latest versions and does not run destructive tests, see the [Building an Upgrade Pipeline](upgrade-pipeline.html) topic. This pipeline is better suited for production purposes than the fresh deploy pipeline.
