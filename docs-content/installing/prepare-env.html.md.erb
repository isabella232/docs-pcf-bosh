This topic describes how to prepare your environment for PCF BOSH by creating the necessary resources.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To automate preparing your environment with a CI/CD pipeline, see the <a href="../automating/pipeline.html#prepare">Prepare Your Environment</a> section of the <em>Building a Pipeline</em> topic.</p>

##<a id='use-terraform'></a>Use Terraform

Pivotal recommends using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to prepare your environment. Terraform is an open-source tool that automates infrastructure configuration. 

The Terraform configuration files required to prepare your environment will vary depending on your IaaS. Refer to the Terraform configuration files in the PCF BOSH Terraforming GCP GitHub [repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-bosh-terraforming-gcp) for preparing Google Cloud Platform as a model.

After setting up your environment, continue to the [Deploying the BOSH Director](deploy-director.html) topic.
