This topic describes how to prepare your environment for BOSH-Native PCF by creating the necessary resources.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To automate preparing your environment with a CI/CD pipeline, see the <a href="../automating/pipeline.html#prepare">Prepare Your Environment</a> section of the <em>Building a Pipeline</em> topic.</p>

##<a id='use-terraform'></a>Use Terraform

Pivotal recommends using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to prepare your environment. Terraform is an open-source tool that automates infrastructure configuration. 

The Terraform configuration files required to prepare your environment will vary depending on your IaaS. Refer to the Terraform configuration files in the BOSH-Native PCF Terraforming GCP GitHub [repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-bosh-terraforming-gcp) for preparing Google Cloud Platform as a model.

After setting up your environment, continue to the [Deploying the BOSH Director](deploy-director.html) topic.
