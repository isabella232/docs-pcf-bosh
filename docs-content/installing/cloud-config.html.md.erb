This topic describes how to create and apply the cloud config, which is a YAML file that defines IaaS-specific configuration used by the BOSH Director and all BOSH deployments.

To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the steps in [Preparing Your Environment](prepare-env.html) and [Deploying the BOSH Director](deploy-director.html). After finishing this topic, continue to [Uploading the Stemcell](upload-stemcell.html). 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To automate applying the cloud config, see the <a href="../automating/pipeline.html#upload">Upload the Stemcell and Cloud Config</a> section of the <em>Building a Pipeline</em> topic.</p>

##<a id='create'></a> Step 1: Create the Cloud Config

Create a YAML file that contains your cloud config. Consult the following links for reference:

* The example cloud config included in the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html#example)
* The cloud config in the `p-ert-bosh-experiment` GitHub [repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/p-ert-bosh-experiment/blob/master/cloud-config.yml), which uses Google Cloud Platform as an IaaS

##<a id='apply'></a> Step 2: Apply the Cloud Config

Follow the instructions in the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html#update) to use the BOSH CLI to update your BOSH Director with the cloud config.

When finished, continue to the [Uploading the Stemcell](upload-stemcell.html) topic.
