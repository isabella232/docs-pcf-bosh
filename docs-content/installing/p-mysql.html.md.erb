##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

MySQL for PCF registers a service broker on Elastic Runtime and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can provision MySQL databases by creating instances of the service plans using [Apps Manager](docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/) or the [cf Command Line Interface (CLI)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/).
