This topic describes how to deploy the BOSH Director with a User Account and Authentication (UAA) server and CredHub.

To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the steps in [Preparing Your Environment](prepare-env.html). After finishing this topic, continue to [Applying the Cloud Config](cloud-config.html). 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To automate deploying the BOSH Director with UAA and CredHub, see the <a href="../automating/pipeline.html#deploy-director">Deploy the BOSH Director</a> section of the <em>Building a Pipeline</em> topic.</p>

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic discusses the following components:

* The **BOSH Director** is the core orchestrating component in BOSH. The Director controls VM creation and deployment, as well as other software and service lifecycle events. For more information, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-components.html#director). 

* **UAA** is a multi-tenant identity management service. By integrating with UAA, the BOSH Director delegates user management to the UAA server. For more information about UAA, see its GitHub [repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa).

* **CredHub** is a [BOSH release](https://bosh.io/docs/release.html) that integrates with the BOSH Director to handle credential generation and management. For more information about CredHub, see its GitHub [repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release).

##<a id='download-cli'></a> Download the BOSH CLI

The procedures in this topic and the rest of the <em>Installing and Configuring</em> topics require the BOSH CLI v2. See the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install) for instructions on how to install the most recent BOSH CLI v2.

##<a id='deploy'></a> Deploy

You can deploy the BOSH Director with UAA and CredHub in one step. 

See the `bosh-deployment` GitHub [repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment) to deploy the BOSH Director with UAA.

See the CredHub GitHub [repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release/wiki/CredHub-Integration-with-BOSH-Director-Configuration-Guide) for a guide that describes how to integrate CredHub with the BOSH Director. The CredHub GitHub repo is not currently public, so you may need to request access from Pivotal.

##<a id='login'></a> Log In

After deploying the BOSH Director, ensure that you can target and log in to your BOSH Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP
Target set to 'DIRECTOR-UUID'
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR-CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>

After successfully deploying the BOSH Director with UAA and CredHub, continue to the [Applying the Cloud Config](cloud-config.html) topic.
