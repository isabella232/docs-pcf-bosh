## <a id='bookbinder'></a>Use Bookbinder To View and Publish Docs

[Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/blob/master/README.md) is a command-line utility for stitching Markdown docs into a hostable web app.

You can use Bookbinder to
* [View](#view) a live version of these docs on your local machine while editing.
* [Publish](#publish) your documentation changes from your local machine to the live docs site.

When you follow the instructions below, you will run `bundle install` locally which will install the `bookbinder` command line utility for you.

### <a id='view'></a> View Docs

To use Bookbinder to view your documentation, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
1. On your local machine, `cd` into `docs-book` in the cloned repo.
1. Run `bundle install` to make sure you have all the necessary gems installed.
1. Run `bookbinder watch` to build an interactive version of the docs and navigate to `localhost:4567/pcfbosh/` in a browser. (It may take a moment for the site to load at first.) This builds a site from your content repo at `docs-content`, and then watches that repo to update the site if you make any changes to the repo.

### <a id='publish'></a> Publish Docs

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
1. On your local machine, `cd` into `docs-book` in the cloned repo.
1. Run `bundle install` to make sure you have all the necessary gems installed.
1. Run `bookbinder bind local` to build a Rack web-app of the book.
1. `cd` into the `final_app` directory.
1. Log into [PEZ HeritageCF](https://apps.run.pez.pivotal.io) and target the appropriate org and space: `cf login -a api.run.pez.pivotal.io -o pcf-bosh -s pcf-bosh --sso`. You'll need to follow the link provided by the `cf` CLI, and then make sure to choose the option to log in with Okta.
1. Run `cf push bosh-native-pcf-docs -b ruby_buildpack -d pezapp.io`.

After the push command has completed, view the docs at https://bosh-native-pcf-docs.pezapp.io/
